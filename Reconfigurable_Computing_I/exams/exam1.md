## Question 1 Programming 
```VHDL


```

## Question 2: 
- Clk, Rst 
- All inputs to logic are not in sensitivity list 
- next_state not defined for all outputs 
	- next_state becomes a latch

## Question 3: 
- A = '1', B='0', C='0'

## Question 4: 
- Find intersection point (got this right)

## Question 5: 
- LUT = I still see 3 LUTs

## Question 6: Bit File
- D LUT Bits = 00000001
- E LUT Bits = 10101010
- D Mux Select = 1
- E Mux Select = 0
- Adjacent CLB Mux = 1
- Entire Bit File: 00000001 1 0 01010101 1

## Question 7 - 9: 
- Submit 9 for a regrade 

## Question 10: 
- LUTs used as small Rams with an asynchronous read 

## Question 11: 
- Everything is correct except the 4 times the configuration memory part 
## Question 12: 
- Connection Boxes, Switch Boxes, Routing Tracks 

## Question 13: 
- Carry Chains 

## Question 14: 
- Violating setup and hold timing 

## Question 15: 
- Reconfigurability, time to Market, Power, Performance

## Question 16: 
- Genetic Algorithms, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing 

## Question 17: 
- All NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time 

## Question 18: 
- Branch and Bound finds the optimal solution 

## Question 19: 
- Route ignoring overuse, update congested resources, rip-up, and reroute 

## Question 20: 
- Bounding Box Area and Routing Channel Capacity 

## Question 21: 
- To apply a reset pulse and verify that output_signal responds correctly after reset
	- wait only makes it work once
