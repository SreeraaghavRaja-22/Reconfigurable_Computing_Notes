## Zynq 
- Combines ARM processor with programmable logic (PL)
	- Artix FPGA
	- DRAM Controller 
	- PCIe controller 
	- Other peripherals 
	- SoC 
- ZedBoard but we only interact with the Zynq processor of the ZedBoard 
- Distributed RAM (Slice M Only)
- Shift-Registers 
	- configures look up table to act like a shift register 
- Research **Slurm**

## Lab 2 Tutorial 
1. Find ZedBoard 
2. 2 Projects: 1 for base design, 1 for peripheral
