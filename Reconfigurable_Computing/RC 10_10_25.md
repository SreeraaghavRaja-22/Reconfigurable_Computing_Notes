# Common forms of HW/SW Communication

## DMA vs. MMIO

- **DMA:** direct memory access
  - HW peripheral has direct access to the microprocessor's memory
  - Process allocates a specific region of memory for the peripheral to access
  - Peripheral accesses using *block transfer*
  - Commonly used by *PCIe* or *PCIe accelerator*
- **MMIO:** memory-mapped I/O
  - Processor just performs load and store instructions
  - Transparent solution for the processor
  - Processor just reads and writes addresses
  - Background has an offset of -4000 so that the each signal corresponds to an address
    - **Example:** go, n, output, and done correspond to addresses 0, 1, 2, or 3
  - **NOTES: Learn AXI as a communication protocol**
